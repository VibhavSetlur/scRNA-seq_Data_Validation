# Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What is the snRNA-seq Pipeline?

The snRNA-seq Pipeline is a comprehensive analysis tool for single-nucleus RNA sequencing data. It provides both a web-based interface and command-line tools for processing, analyzing, and visualizing single-cell data using the Seurat package.

### What data formats are supported?

The pipeline supports:
- **H5 files**: 10X Genomics filtered feature-barcode matrices
- **RDS files**: Pre-processed Seurat objects
- **SouporCell output**: Doublet detection results (optional)

### How do I get started?

1. Upload your data file (H5 or RDS)
2. Configure analysis parameters
3. Click "Run Pipeline" to start the analysis
4. View results in the Results tab

## Data Input

### What is the difference between H5 and RDS files?

- **H5 files**: Raw data from 10X Genomics Cell Ranger output
- **RDS files**: Pre-processed Seurat objects that can be loaded directly

### Can I use data from other single-cell platforms?

The pipeline is optimized for 10X Genomics data, but RDS files from other platforms may work if they follow Seurat object format.

### How large can my dataset be?

The pipeline can handle datasets with thousands to hundreds of thousands of cells, depending on your system's memory and computational resources.

### What is SouporCell and do I need it?

SouporCell is a tool for doublet detection in single-cell data. It's optional but recommended for improving data quality by removing doublets.

## Analysis Parameters

### What are good default parameters?

The default parameters work well for most datasets:
- Minimum features: 200
- Minimum counts: 1000
- Variable features: 2000
- Clustering resolution: 0.5

### How do I choose QC thresholds?

Start with default values and adjust based on your data:
- Use QC plots to visualize distributions
- Consider your tissue type and experimental design
- Balance between data quality and cell retention

### What clustering algorithm should I use?

- **leiden**: Recommended for most datasets
- **louvain**: Alternative option
- **multilevel**: For specific cases
- **slm**: For large datasets

### How do I adjust the number of clusters?

Use the clustering resolution parameter:
- Lower values (0.1-0.3): Fewer, larger clusters
- Higher values (0.8-1.2): More, smaller clusters

## Results and Output

### What output files are generated?

The pipeline creates:
- Quality control plots and summaries
- Processing visualizations (PCA, variable features)
- Clustering results (UMAP plots, cluster assignments)
- Marker analysis (differential expression)
- Final processed Seurat object

### How do I interpret the results?

- **QC plots**: Check data quality and filtering
- **UMAP plots**: Visualize cell clusters
- **Marker analysis**: Identify cluster-specific genes
- **Statistics**: Quantitative summaries of your data

### Can I download the results?

Yes, all results can be downloaded from the Results tab, including plots, tables, and the final Seurat object.

### How do I continue analysis in R?

Load the final RDS file in R:
```r
library(Seurat)
seurat_object <- readRDS("path/to/your_project_processed.rds")
```

## Technical Issues

### The app is slow or unresponsive

- Reduce dataset size if possible
- Use fewer variable features
- Close other applications
- Consider using the command-line interface for large datasets

### I get memory errors

- Increase R memory limit: `export R_MAX_MEM_SIZE=16G`
- Use smaller datasets
- Reduce analysis parameters
- Use the terminal interface

### The pipeline fails to run

- Check input data format
- Verify all required packages are installed
- Try more conservative parameters
- Check the logs for specific error messages

### Can I run the pipeline without the web interface?

Yes, use the command-line interface:
```bash
Rscript run_pipeline_terminal.R --help
```

## Deployment and Installation

### How do I deploy on a server?

Use the provided Docker configuration:
```bash
./deploy.sh deploy
```

### Can I run this on a cluster?

Yes, the command-line interface is designed for cluster environments. Use the terminal script with appropriate resource allocation.

### What are the system requirements?

- R 4.3.0 or higher
- Sufficient RAM (8GB minimum, 16GB+ recommended)
- Storage space for data and results
- Docker (for containerized deployment)

### How do I update the pipeline?

- Pull the latest version from the repository
- Rebuild the Docker image if using containers
- Update R packages if needed

## Advanced Usage

### Can I customize the analysis workflow?

Yes, you can modify the source code or use the command-line interface for custom workflows.

### How do I integrate with other tools?

The pipeline outputs standard Seurat objects that can be used with other R packages and tools.

### Can I run batch analyses?

Yes, use the command-line interface with scripts to process multiple datasets.

### How do I cite this pipeline?
