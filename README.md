# Comprehensive Seurat Single-Cell RNA-seq Pipeline

## Description

This script offers a robust and customizable command-line solution for processing single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) data using the powerful Seurat R package. Designed for both raw 10X Genomics H5 data and existing Seurat objects, it guides users through essential analysis steps including rigorous quality control (QC), data normalization and scaling, dimensionality reduction (PCA), graph-based clustering, UMAP visualization, and optional differential gene expression (DEG) analysis for cluster marker identification. A key feature is the integrated support for doublet removal using output from the SouporCell tool. The pipeline is built for ease of use in computational environments and supports batch processing workflows.

## Motivation

Single-cell RNA sequencing data is high-dimensional and inherently noisy. Analyzing this data requires a systematic approach to identify distinct cell populations and understand their molecular characteristics. This pipeline automates the standard steps of a Seurat-based analysis, allowing researchers to efficiently process multiple samples, ensure reproducibility, and focus on interpreting the biological insights from their data. Automating these steps via a command-line script is particularly useful for high-throughput projects and integration into larger bioinformatics workflows.

## Features

* **Flexible Data Input:** Seamlessly initiates the pipeline from either a raw 10X Genomics filtered feature-barcode matrix in H5 format or a previously saved Seurat object in RDS format.
* **Automated Package Management:** Includes a built-in mechanism to check for and automatically install necessary R packages if they are not already found.
* **Detailed Quality Control (QC):** Executes crucial QC steps to assess cell quality. This includes calculating the percentage of reads mapping to mitochondrial genes and generating informative plots (`VlnPlot`, `FeatureScatter`, histograms) to visualize key metrics (features per cell, counts per cell, mitochondrial percentage) *before* and *after* filtering.
* **Integrated Doublet Filtering:** Optionally removes predicted doublet cells using the `clusters.tsv` output generated by SouporCell. The script specifically retains cells classified as 'singlet' or 'unclassified'.
* **Customizable Filtering:** When starting from raw H5 data, applies user-defined thresholds for minimum number of features and counts per cell to remove low-quality cells.
* **Data Normalization:** Supports common Seurat normalization methods (`LogNormalize`, `RC`, `CLR`) to account for differences in sequencing depth and other technical variations between cells.
* **Data Scaling:** Scales and centers the data, a necessary step before PCA, using either a 'negbinom' (recommended for UMI data) or 'linear' model to ensure genes contribute equitably to dimensionality reduction. Only scales highly variable features to improve efficiency.
* **Dimensionality Reduction (PCA):** Performs Principal Component Analysis to reduce data dimensionality while preserving major sources of variation. The number of principal components to compute and use is a user-defined parameter.
* **Graph Construction:** Builds a cell-cell nearest neighbor graph using the 'Annoy' method and subsequently identifies cell clusters based on shared nearest neighbors (SNN).
* **Flexible Clustering Algorithms:** Offers a choice of clustering algorithms (`louvain`, `multilevel`, `leiden`, `slm`) to partition cells into distinct groups based on the SNN graph.
* **Tunable Clustering Resolution:** The resolution parameter for clustering can be adjusted via a command-line argument, allowing users to control the granularity of the identified clusters.
* **UMAP Visualization:** Computes a 2-dimensional Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) embedding to visualize the relationships between cells and clusters in a low-dimensional space.
* **Optional Differential Gene Expression (DEG) Analysis:** Can optionally identify genes that are differentially expressed between the identified cell clusters using the 'DESeq2' test (note included about suitability for low cell counts).
* **Comprehensive Logging:** Provides detailed progress messages and warnings during script execution.
* **Robust Error Handling:** Includes checks and `tryCatch` blocks to manage potential errors and warnings during Seurat function calls, aiming to complete as many steps as possible even if intermediate steps encounter issues.
* **Output Saving:** Saves all generated plots (PNG format for static, HTML for interactive variable features), the marker list (CSV format, if enabled), and the constructed neighbor and SNN graphs (RDS format). The final processed Seurat object is also saved as an RDS file.

## Pipeline Steps Explained in Detail
### Data Loading:
The script first checks if either --rds_input or --h5_input is provided and exists. If an RDS path is given, it loads the pre-processed Seurat object using readRDS(). If an H5 path is given, it reads the raw count matrix using Read10X_h5() and creates a new Seurat object using CreateSeuratObject(). An error occurs if no valid input file is provided.

### Quality Control (QC):
QC steps are performed regardless of the input type (H5 or RDS). PercentageFeatureSet() is used to calculate the percentage of mitochondrial reads for each cell, stored in seurat_object$percent.mt. Summary statistics (min, median, max) for features, counts, and percent.mt are calculated and printed to the console and included in plot subtitles before any filtering. Static visualizations (VlnPlot, FeatureScatter, ggplot histogram) are generated for pre-filtered data metrics. Doublet Filtering (Optional): If a --soupor_cell_doublet_input file is provided, the script reads the SouporCell clusters.tsv. It identifies cell barcodes classified as 'singlet' or 'unclassified' and subsets the Seurat object to keep only these cells. Cells explicitly labeled as 'doublet' are removed. Basic checks are included for file existence and column names. Filtering (H5 Input Only): If the input was an H5 file, the script then applies hard filters based on the --min_features and --min_counts arguments, removing cells that fall below these thresholds. This step is skipped if starting from an RDS object. Summary statistics for features, counts, and percent.mt are calculated and printed to the console and included in plot subtitles after all filtering steps (doublet and min_features/counts if applicable). Static visualizations (VlnPlot, FeatureScatter, ggplot histogram) are generated for post-filtered data metrics (only if H5 input was used and cells remain). Bar plots showing the total number of cells and total reads before and after all filtering steps are generated and saved.

### Normalization:
The script normalizes the expression data using NormalizeData(). The specific method is controlled by the --normalization_method argument (LogNormalize, RC, or CLR). The scale.factor is set appropriately based on the chosen method (defaulting to 10000 for CLR and using Seurat defaults for others).

### Variable Feature Selection:
Identifies a set of highly variable genes using FindVariableFeatures(). The 'vst' (variance stabilizing transformation) method is used. The number of variable features found is controlled by --n_variable_features. A check is included to ensure the requested number doesn't exceed the total features in the object. An interactive HTML plot of variable features is generated using plotly and ggrepel for labeling, allowing hovering to see gene names.

### Scaling:
Scales and centers the data for the identified variable features using ScaleData(). The model.use parameter is set based on the --scaling_method argument ('negbinom' or 'linear'). Scaling is crucial to ensure that genes with higher expression levels don't unduly influence downstream dimensionality reduction.

### Dimensionality Reduction (PCA):
Performs PCA on the scaled variable features using RunPCA(). The number of principal components to compute is controlled by --pca_dimensions. A check is included to ensure this number does not exceed the number of variable features. Static plots showing the PCA embedding and an Elbow plot (to help assess relevant dimensions) are generated. A DimHeatmap is also created showing top genes per PC.

### Clustering:
Builds a cell-cell nearest neighbor graph based on the chosen PCA dimensions using FindNeighbors(). The nn.method is set to 'annoy' for efficiency. The graph object is saved as an RDS. Constructs the Shared Nearest Neighbor (SNN) graph, which is used for clustering. The SNN graph object is also saved as an RDS. Identifies clusters using FindClusters(). The resolution parameter is set by --clustering_resolution. The algorithm parameter is set by --clustering_algorithm (louvain, multilevel, leiden, slm). The clustering results are stored in the Seurat object's metadata.

### UMAP Embedding:
Computes a 2D UMAP embedding based on the same PCA dimensions used for clustering using RunUMAP(). A static UMAP plot is generated, automatically colored by the identified clusters and labeled for easy interpretation. The plot title includes information about the clustering parameters and PCA dimensions used.

### Optional Marker Finding:
If the --find_markers argument is set to TRUE, the script proceeds to find differentially expressed genes for each cluster using FindAllMarkers(). The test.use parameter is set to 'DESeq2'. Important Consideration for test.use='DESeq2': The 'DESeq2' test is a powerful method for differential expression, but it's primarily designed for bulk RNA-seq experiments with multiple replicates per group. While it can be applied to single-cell data, it is less appropriate for clusters with very low cell counts (ideally requires at least 2 replicates/cells per group). Seurat's default test, 'wilcox' (Wilcoxon Rank Sum test), or the 'negbinom' test are often considered more statistically robust and widely used for single-cell differential expression analysis, particularly when dealing with clusters that have very few cells. The script includes a warning if the minimum cluster size is less than 2. If you are working with small or rare cell populations, or prefer a different statistical approach, you might consider performing marker finding interactively in R/RStudio after loading the processed Seurat object, or modifying the script to use a different test.use method. Parameters like logfc.threshold and min.pct (set to 0.1 in your script) and return.thresh are used to filter markers. The resulting marker table is saved as a CSV file, with the filename indicating the clustering resolution and algorithm used.

### Saving Final Object:
The processed Seurat object, containing all the results from the pipeline steps (QC, normalization, scaling, PCA, clustering, UMAP), is saved as an RDS file in the working directory.

### Doublet Filtering with SouporCell Explained
The --soupor_cell_doublet_input argument allows you to leverage the results of SouporCell for doublet removal. SouporCell is a tool that analyzes genetic variation (specifically, variants in the reads mapped to each cell) to identify potential doublets resulting from loading multiple cells into a single droplet. Its clusters.tsv output file provides a classification for each cell barcode, typically assigning a 'status' of 'singlet', 'doublet', or 'unclassified'.

When you provide the path to this file using the --soupor_cell_doublet_input argument, the script reads the file and extracts the 'barcode' and 'status' columns. It then subsets the Seurat object to keep only the cell barcodes that SouporCell identified as 'singlet' or 'unclassified'. Cells explicitly labeled with the 'doublet' status are removed from the analysis. The script includes checks to ensure the SouporCell file exists and has the expected 'barcode' column to prevent errors.

Note on 'Unclassified' Cells: The script includes 'unclassified' cells by default based on your code. These cells have ambiguous SouporCell classifications and may represent technical artifacts or true singlets that couldn't be confidently assigned. Depending on your specific dataset characteristics and confidence in the SouporCell results, you might choose to filter these out manually after the pipeline runs, or modify the script to exclude them if a stricter filtering is desired.

### Optional Marker Finding
The --find_markers argument is a boolean flag (TRUE or FALSE) that controls whether the FindAllMarkers function is executed. This function performs differential gene expression analysis to identify genes that are significantly upregulated in each identified cell cluster compared to all other cells.

When --find_markers is TRUE, the script runs FindAllMarkers using the 'DESeq2' test, a method commonly used for differential expression analysis. The script uses a log2 fold-change threshold of 0.25, requires a minimum of 10% of cells in either of the two groups to express the gene (min.pct = 0.1), and uses a p-value adjusted threshold of 0.05 (return.thresh = 0.05).

Important Consideration for test.use='DESeq2': While 'DESeq2' is a powerful statistical framework, it is primarily designed for bulk RNA-seq experiments with biological replicates within each condition. While it can be applied to single-cell data, it is less appropriate for clusters with very low cell counts (ideally requires at least 2 replicates/cells per group). Seurat's default test, 'wilcox' (Wilcoxon Rank Sum test), or the 'negbinom' test are often considered more statistically robust and widely used for single-cell differential expression analysis, particularly when dealing with clusters that have very few cells. The script includes a warning if the minimum cluster size is less than 2. If you are working with small or rare cell populations, or prefer a different statistical approach, you might consider performing marker finding interactively in R/RStudio after loading the processed Seurat object, or modifying the script to use a different test.use method.

### Working Directory
It is strongly recommended to use the --working_dir argument to specify a dedicated output directory for each sample or analysis run. This helps keep your project files organized and prevents output files from different runs from overwriting each other. The script will create the directory if it doesn't exist. Ensure the user running the script has write permissions to this directory.

## Tips and Best Practices
##### Choosing QC Thresholds: 
The default --min_features (200) and --min_counts (1000) are common starting points, but these should be adjusted based on the specific distribution of your data visible in the pre-filter QC plots and your knowledge of the expected cell quality. Look for inflection points in the cumulative distribution of counts and features.
#### Selecting PCA Dimensions: 
The --pca_dimensions argument is crucial for capturing the major sources of variation while reducing noise. The Elbow plot ([project_name]_PCA.1.png) can help you decide how many PCs to include. Look for an "elbow" point where the variance explained by subsequent PCs drops significantly. You can also consider using JackStraw analysis interactively in R/RStudio after the script runs to determine statistically significant PCs.
#### Choosing Clustering Resolution: 
The --clustering_resolution parameter directly impacts the number and granularity of the resulting clusters. Higher values lead to more clusters. Experiment with different resolutions to find a level of clustering that aligns with your biological questions and expected cell populations.
#### Interpreting Plots: 
Use the generated plots to assess the quality of your data and the results of each analysis step. The QC plots help you understand the initial data quality and the impact of filtering. The PCA, UMAP, and Variable Feature plots help you assess the dimensionality reduction and feature selection. The UMAP plot with clusters is the primary visualization for cell type identification.
#### Resource Management (Parallel Runs): 
When running the parallel Bash script for multiple samples, carefully consider the number of --pca_dimensions and whether --find_markers is enabled, as these steps can be computationally and memory intensive. Adjust the num_jobs parameter in your Bash script based on the available CPU cores and memory on your system to avoid overloading it.
#### Interactive Exploration: 
The final [project_name]_processed.rds Seurat object is your primary resource for further interactive analysis in R or RStudio. You can load this object to perform manual cluster annotation, visualize specific gene expression, run additional analyses, etc.

### Troubleshooting
##### Missing Packages: 
If the script fails with a missing package error, ensure your internet connection is active and R can access CRAN to install them. If behind a firewall, you might need to configure R's proxy settings.
##### File Not Found: 
Double-check the paths provided for --rds_input, --h5_input, and --soupor_cell_doublet_input. Ensure the files exist at those exact locations and that the user running the script has read permissions.
##### Seurat Function Errors: 
Errors during Seurat function calls (like NormalizeData, RunPCA, FindClusters) might indicate issues with the data itself (e.g., no cells remaining after filtering, all values being zero). Check the logging messages for specific error details and review the QC plots and summary statistics to understand the state of the data before the failing step.
##### Memory Errors: 
If the script runs out of memory, especially during scaling, PCA, or marker finding on large datasets, consider reducing the number of variable features (--n_variable_features), the number of PCA dimensions (--pca_dimensions), or processing samples individually rather than in parallel (or reduce the number of parallel jobs).
